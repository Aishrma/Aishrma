# 👋 Hello, I'm Shubhranil Basak

## 🧠 About Me
I'm currently diving deep into the world of **Machine Learning** with a growing passion for **Generative AI (GenAI)** — exploring how machines can create, learn, and generate content intelligently. I enjoy experimenting with GenAI models and building projects that blend creativity with AI capabilities.

In parallel, I have solid experience in **Full-Stack Web Development**, which enables me to develop and deploy complete, end-to-end applications. My goal is to bridge the gap between intelligent models and practical, real-world applications.
